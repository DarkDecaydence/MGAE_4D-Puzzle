\section{Project Description}
The goal of this project was create a puzzle game using the Unity 3d-engine. This game should incorporate a fourth spatial dimension, making it a 4d-puzzle game, which require a fourth dimension being implemented in the Unity 3d-engine.
\subsection{Design and Features}
The design and desired features of the game can be divided into two groups: 4d-mechanics and 3d-mechanics. This distinction separates the design into features that are unique to the 4d-design of the game, and the features which still functions with the absence of a fourth spatial dimension.
\subsubsection{3d-Mechanics}
These are the desired features which are not dependent on the existence of a fourth spatial dimension. 
The following list aims to define and clarify each feature and their dependence on other parts of the design.
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3d-FPS movement: A player character controlled from a first person perspective using the keyboard and mouse. Allowing the player to traverse, perceive and interact with the game world.
	\item Picking up and moving objects: The player must be able to pick up certain game objects. When an object is picked up, it must be held in front of the player character until dropped, allowing the player to move it from one place in the game world to another.
	\item Moving objects: Certain objects like doors must be able to move or rotate.
	\item Interactible objects: The player must be able to interact with certain game objects. These objects can be used like buttons with various effects like opening a door or calling an elevator. The interactible objects must also have the ability to be locked and requiring a certain key to be present. The interactible objects must be implemented in such a way that it can be used in combination with other parts of the design eg. moving an object by pressing a button.
	\item Display/Monitor: 
	\item UI Crosshair:
	\item UI Mini-map:  
	
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{4d-Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collisions: 
	\item Moving:
	\item Rendering/Coloring:
\end{itemize}
