\section{Conclusion}
The final product differs from our vision in that we have multiple small levels and rather simple puzzles instead of one large level featured complicated puzzles. This deviation is largely constituted to an unrealistic scope and setbacks during development. The technical capabilities of the game supports most of the envisioned features, however time limited the level design and the content creation and in the end many ideas - like elevators, machines and displays - were not implemented even though the functionality is present.\\

Much is still left to be desired especially from a Game Design perspective, but from a technical point of view the game almost fulfills our goals as our work with the Unity engine has concluded in a 4d-puzzle game albeit we are not demonstrating the full potential of our features.
