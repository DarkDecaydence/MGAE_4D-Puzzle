\section{Conclusion}
The final product differs from our vision in that we have multiple small levels and rather simple puzzles, instead of one large level featuring complicated puzzles. This deviation is largely due to an unrealistic scope and setbacks during development. The technical capabilities of the game supports most of the envisioned features, however time limited the level design and content creation. In the end, many ideas - like elevators, machines, and displays - were not implemented, even though the functionality for such features is present within the game code.\\

Much is still left to be desired, especially from a Game Design perspective. From a technical point of view though, the game almost fulfils our goals, and our work with the Unity engine has concluded in a 4D-puzzle game, albeit one that is not demonstrating the full potential of our features.
