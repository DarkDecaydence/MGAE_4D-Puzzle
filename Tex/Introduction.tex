\section{Introduction}
 This paper is an technical account of the the design and implementation of the game Redshift in the Unity game engine. This paper will present the initial concept idea and the vision behind the game, followed by a chronological account of the development process and finally an analysis of the implementation and of alternative solutions evaluating the final implementation.
\subsection{Scope and Context}
The development of Redshift was the subject of two exam projects at the IT-University of Copenhagen during the fall semester of 2015.
These two projects belonged to two different course - Game Design and Game Engines.
The scope of these two projects are very different, as game Design is focused on the design of mechanics and aesthetics of games, where as Game Engines is focused on working with game engines - coding, scripting, etc.\\

This paper is part of the project on Game Engines, thus the subjects pertaining to the game's design and it's mechanics is not within the scope of this paper. However the focus will be on the implementation of said mechanics.
The projects done for Game Design are usually technically simple and often done with 2d-graphics. However merging the Game Design and Game Engines projects allowed for a more technically challenging features and mechanics.\\

The team on the Game Design project included two additional members. These members had only very limited technical experience and was assigned the roles of designers. Working asset creation, ie. sounds, texture, models. They did not work on the scripts, and did only limited work in the Unity editor. Any content created by these members has been gathered in a list(\textbf{SE APPENDIX}).
